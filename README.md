# :older_woman:Age-related Study of MSI and ADHD in R

## Background
Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is a highly prevalent neurodevelopmental condition, which may be associated with life-enduring cognitive dysfunction. It has been hypothesized that age-related cognitive decline may overlap with preexisting deficits in older ADHD patients, leading to increased problems to manage everyday-life activities. This phenomenon may mimic neurodegenerative disorders, in particular Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI). This cross-sectional study aims to assess cognitive and behavioral differences between older subjects with ADHD and MCI.

## Objectives
The main goal was to visualise the data [1] and find patterns in them. Additionally an attempt was made to find a suitable model for disease prediction from psychological profile of the patient. Using another dataset [2], a shiny application was made with the ability to explore data on patients suffering from ADHD and ASD.

## What was done:
- data visualisation
- statistical analysis (including ANOVA)
- linear model
- web application

## Methods
- RMarkdown
- Ggplot2 (with GGally and cowplot)
- Car
- Shiny
